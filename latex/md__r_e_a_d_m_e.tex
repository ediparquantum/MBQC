Measurement-\/based quantum computation (MBQC) is an alternative computational model to the circuit-\/based quantum computation (CBQC) model. While many quantum computing simulators like Qiskit-\/aer, Py\+Quil-\/qvm, and Qu\+EST are based on the CBQC model, Qu\+EST stands out by offering flexibility with mid-\/circuit measurement and the ability to perform feed-\/forward actions, such as adaptive basis measurements for future qubits. This repository aims to simulate a general MBQC framework using Qu\+EST and leveraging the Boost Graph Library (\href{https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_78_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html}{\texttt{ BGL}}), which is developed under the \href{https://www.boost.org/}{\texttt{ Boost}} library in C++.

By combining Qu\+EST\textquotesingle{}s capabilities with the power of the Boost Graph Library, this project provides a versatile MBQC simulator. As more verification protocols rely on MBQC, this repository can prove to be a valuable resource.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{What is MBQC}{What is MBQC}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}

This project is in active development, labelled as version 0.\+01. There is some basic functionality in this repositors, but by no means is a complete simulator. To run this repository see below for external library requirements.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{External library requirements}{External library requirements}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
Along with the standard C/\+C++ libraries there are two additional external libraries. Since MBQC is a graph theoretic based paradigm, the numerical library, Boost is called and with it, its graph library. To performthe quantum computation the current backend simulator is Qu\+EST. Each of these libraries can be found here\+:

These (Boost and Qu\+EST) are both REQUIRED to run this MBQC.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download boost, the {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} file in the root of this repository attempts to find Boost. For any trouble with this step please open and issue and we will respond as soon as possible.
\item Download the Qu\+EST repository from Git\+Hub and save the folder to {\ttfamily \$HOME/\+Projects/\+Qu\+EST/} and {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} should be able to load it. For any trouble with this step please open and issue and we will respond as soon as possible. (Note that {\ttfamily \$HOME} is used in Linux to represent the home directory such as {\ttfamily /home/username/}

To run a simple script executing a two dimensional lattice graph and measuring every qubit do the following


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone this repos with {\ttfamily git clone git@github.\+com\+:ediparquantum/\+MBQC.\+git} (I use ssh, use what works for you) to {\ttfamily \$HOME/\+Projects}
\item Navigate to {\ttfamily \$HOME/\+Projects} (eg {\ttfamily cd \$HOME/\+Projects/\+MBQC})
\item Make a directory called {\ttfamily build} in {\ttfamily \$HOME/\+Projects/\+MBQC} with {\ttfamily mkdir build}.
\item Navigate to {\ttfamily build} (eg {\ttfamily cd build} assuming you are already in {\ttfamily cd \$HOME/\+Projects/\+MBQC})
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Now you are ready to run cmake\+: {\ttfamily cmake ..} and should see



Now run {\ttfamily make} and should see



Now run {\ttfamily ./mbqc\+Starter\+File} and should see



For any trouble with this step please open and issue and we will respond as soon as possible.
